# fabricated-exchange

A Fabric remake of the Minecraft mod ProjectE/Equivalent Exchange 2.
The mod attaches an "EMC" number value to every item. Some are worth more, some less.
Transmute items and blocks into EMC, and EMC to different items you've obtained before.

The mod is currently in beta. It is targetting 1.19.4. Once it is in a stable, feature complete state, 
I will port it to older versions that are popular for moddding. Afterwards it will be upgraded to whatever versions after 1.19.4 that are most popular for mods.

All of the assets were taken from https://github.com/sinkillerj/ProjectE.
If the author(s) of the assets do not want this project using them, I will take the project 
down until I can replace the assets myself. 

According to the ProjectE description, the following people deserve credit for the assets:

# Something isn't working

You're actually wrong. Everything is working. You must be hallucinating.
In any case, open an issue on this repository. 

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome.

This is my very first Fabric mod, and so I am unfamiliar with good Fabric mod practices.
If you spot anything that is done incorrectly, unsafely, or that could be done more 
efficiently, please open an issue/pull request a change.

Additionally, as of now, the mod is still under development. So you could also suggest or implement
new features, or old features from previous equivalence mods.

If you do want to contribute, please open an issue regarding the potential pull request
to avoid the situation where two people work on the same thing (unless it's a minor change).
